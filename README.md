# The_Three_Body_Problem
This repository contains code that simulates the classic three-body problem, focusing specifically on the scenario involving Earth and two satellites. Due to the satellites having negligible mass compared to Earth, this problem is simplified. The trajectory of the three bodies is visualized using VPython.

Problem 1: Simulating the motion of artificial satellites having different mass

Problem 2: Simulating the motion of two artificial satellites around Earth having same mass

Problem 3: Simulating the motion of the same artificial satellites using Leapfrog method
